# Stream-based Data Synchronization

This repository contains the source code I've written in support of the
article on [Stream-based Data Synchronization](https://medium.com/@klemen.verdnik/stream-based-data-synchronization-41ff242327ec)
I've published on [medium.com](http://medium.com). The publication talks about
a specific way to synchronize a shared data model across devices by
transmitting non-reconciled model changes over network, instead of fully
hydrated, up-to-date objects. The approach is supported with code snippets
written in Swift.

If you have any questions or comments about this work, please contact me.
